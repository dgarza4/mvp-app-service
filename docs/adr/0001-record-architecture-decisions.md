## Context and Problem Statement

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision Outcome

We will use Markdown Architecture Decision Records (MADR), as [described in https://adr.github.io/madr/](https://adr.github.io/madr/).

## Consequences

For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
